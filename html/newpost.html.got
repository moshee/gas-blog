<!--
There will be a real-time markup parser implemented in JS.
It will actively search for image links. And other upload links.
I'm not sure how this will be implemented in the markup.
Each time it detects a file upload, an upload file thing will be appended to the form.
It may also actively search for errors.

<!--
There will be no "post" button. Just a "preview" button.
There will be a box on the bottom that appears via JS.
It will send the current data stored in the form and use blog/onepost to render a test page.
It will acquire the test page using XHR.
This will be the preview mechanism.
Once the post has been previewed, the real "post" button will appear.
